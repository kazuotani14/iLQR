Test everything individually by replicating function, testing with multiple
inputs, and comparing vs matlab.
Write tests for functions before starting implementation (if it's simple enough)
Best way to do this - refactor into a standalone function during testing?

For now, I am skipping the vectorization/parallelization of the forward pass so that
we can get this up and running quickly.

Figure out where to put past inputs.

Stuff to do (in approximate order)

- step 2~4 in iLQR_core
- make sure everything compiles and runs when generate_trajectory is called (no eigen fails)

Check inputs/outputs individually:
- init_traj
- forward_pass
- backward_pass

- correct tire dynamic model according to cyrus' commit on matlab repo
- iLQR::init_traj (check pending)
- iLQR::forward_pass - almost done, need control_limits to be implemented
- iLQR::backward_pass -
- step 2 in iLQR_core
- step 3 in iLQR_core
>>>>>>> 50a6a74... Update TODO.txt

- integrate cost for change in control input
- printing stuff in iLQR_main at every iteration
- write final control sequence and states to text file
- test whole thing and see if output looks reasonable - plot in matlab

Later on:
- fix all the messy stuff
	- sort out public/private in classes
	- figure out how to have less arguments for methods - pass structs
	- extract methods into smaller methods, especially in fw, bw, boxQP

- make it faster
	- see what the ddp-generator guy did to optimize
		- only calculate upper triangle in symmetric matrices
	- see links in notes
	- consts everywhere
	- vectorize for parallel line search

- make ir more readable
	- see google cpp style guide
	- refactor to completely separate iLQR class from Model class
		- make sure everything in iLQR is dimension-agnostic
	- make it reusable
		- make skeleton for new Model class, for reference

- add documentation
- eigen helper functions are all inline right now to prevent duplicate symbol error
